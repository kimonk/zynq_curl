This directory contains the curl application which should be compiled as an app 
in the target rootfs of your petalinux project. This app is based on libcurl so 
it fundamental that libcurl has been added and compiled into the rootfs first.
Adding the app to your petalinux project is simple enough. Just type:

petalinux-create -t apps --template c --name curl --enable 

anywhere inside an already create petalinux project. This will create a 
./components/apps/curl project with some template files to get you started. 
Simply replace those files with the ones in this directory and type:

petalinux-build -c rootfs/curl 

to compile the app.
