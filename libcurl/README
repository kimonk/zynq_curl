This is the source for the libcurl library that powers the curl app. You can add this 
to your petalinux project by typing:

petalinux-create -t libs --name libcurl --enable

and then replace the files create in the ./components/libs/libcurl folder with the 
files found here. You can erase the libcurl.c and libcurl.h created automatically
by petalinux though it doesn't matter as they'll be ignored be the Makefile.
