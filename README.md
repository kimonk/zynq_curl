# zynq_curl
This repo contains compile-ready curl and libcurl SW for the Petalinux platform on Xilinx's Zynq.
It has been tested only rudimentary in our design which uses curl to post data from the Zynq's PS
to a web server. If you come across any issues when using it, add an issue on the repo so I can
have a look into that.
